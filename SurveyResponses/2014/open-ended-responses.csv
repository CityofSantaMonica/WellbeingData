Really need to get wise engineers in the future planning. New theaters at Santa Monica place will be nice yet I think having few less and adding a club or at least a fun piano bar (even dueling pianos) something to give the city more nightlife balance would be enjoyable.  Right now we just have tiny bars and restaurants with dj's.  Not much music life here.  Lots more to add but I'll refrain further.

2015,"Things that influence my wellbeing:  1) The rent here is ridiculous. You ask about knowing my neighbors. It is impossible to make friends with people because, usually the cost of rent, people are moving in and out of our building almost every 3 months. Sometimes I feel like I am a stranger in my own neighborhood because only people with higher incomes can now live here, restaurants seem to be catering more and more to higher incomes, etc.   2) The amount of homeless people, usually angry ones, is getting out of control.  3) Now that Santa Monica has become pedestrian and bike friendly anarchy has ensued. People are constantly jaywalking and a lot of people on bikes think it's funny to zig zag in lanes. Thanks. How about ticketing them like you do cars???!!! 4) [XXX] 5) Why does the City spend my tax dollars on bus stops that are a joke. There better not be more than one person standing there when it's raining. What the hell was someone thinking? Are we too good to have bus stops that are better like ones in other cities. Oh, and those fancy shorter light posts like the ones along Pico. Um, they don't really provide light and I want a refund. 4th street south of Pico is pitch black, how about some lights there!!!!!!  6) Why are community meetings that would be helpful to me such as the Emergency preparedness, rent control, etc. are on times that are unrealistic such as Monday morning at 10am or in the middle of the afternoon! Um, some of us work. Maybe there could be 3 meetings for the same things at times that would be in consideration for all members of Santa Monica!  7) [XXX] First, ever since the police were removed from the second street parking structure the response time is unacceptable. As you are probably aware, merchants have theft and we have homeless people who are *very* aggressive. Why am I paying for new patches that say PSO instead of CSO? Why do the ambassadors t-shirts keep changing? Again, I want a refund.  8) The parking here can be summed up in one word: greedy. My friends and customers don't want to come down here because of the cost of parking!!!!! As one of your parking managers told me ""that is their prerogative"".

This worries me.  The city is its employees and officials are totally unsupportive and do not care and have done nothing to improve our life here int he 90405. We pay more taxes for the inconvenience of living here and it has gotten much worse over the last 5 years with increased development and increased enrollment at SMC.  The elementary school in our neighborhood has declined and the classes are over crowded. It is not worth living here and we are professionals and would love to move if we could find employment elsewhere. It is not worth it to live in the southern section of Santa Monica.  This is a city divided by the 10 freeway and a city counsel who only cares about the developers and not about its residents. They claim they are developing to assist low cost housing but that is not true.  Santa Monica is over crowded and there is no effort made to decrease the congestion on Pico, Ocean Park and Pearl streets (a small residential street that is used as an alternative to the 10).  The airport noise is out of control and the pollution from the jets and the traffic concerns me and I'm concerned about the health of my minor children.  Again, the City Counsel and Santa Monica officials appear indifferent.  Maybe it is because they all live in the protected North of Montana section of the city where there  is no traffic and the schools have programs for children who are advanced.  On our end of town we only have programs for children with special educational needs, but at Franklin they have a special teacher for gifted children. Why don't the kids in the 90405 have the same opportunities?  If anybody asked me if they should move the Santa Monica,I would tell them NO. Don't waste your money.  You will pay extra for traffic, pollution, a city counsel in the pocket of developers, under performing over crowded schools and the inability to maintain your home due to regressive regulations that create extra taxation in the form of a permitting system that unreasonably regulates any home improvement.  So, if you purchase a home in Santa Monica there is a disincentive to maintaining your property or improving it. Yet, developers are easily able to purchase homes , scrape the lots and build a new home.  The stress caused by the traffic and noise is affecting my wellbeing.  Our community is being suffocated by the over development, traffic and airport noise and pollution and the disincentive to improve and maintain our property.

Driving to downtown LA or Hollywood for shows is practically impossible in weeknight traffic, and as a result, it is much harder for Westside residents to enjoy the arts. 2) Santa Monica should continue efforts to close the airport, which is a source of constant noise. At least close the flight schools, which are responsible for much of the noise--and we should not have student pilots practicing over urban neighborhoods. 3) I would like to get back to doing bootcamps with my neighbors in Santa Monica's own parks. I used to work out with a very nice group in Clover Park, but the City Council passed such high usage fees that the class had to move to Penmar Park in Venice. This is a much dingier and more depressing setting. An affordable boot camp was one of the ways I enjoyed the outdoors, stayed fit, and used the parks, but the City Council made it impossible for our teacher to make a living within the SM city limits. Now outdoor fitness training is only available for rich people in Santa Monica. 4) Focus on beautifying Lincoln Boulevard in Ocean Park.

We need to do a better job of cleaning it up if we're going to be named one of the best cities to live in.    - Transportation. Santa Monica is a small community (particularly west of Lincoln) and there should be more city-supported transportation options like electric vehicle rides or golf cart rides between neighborhoods in/around SaMo, e.g. 3rd St. Promenade to Main St. or Main St. to Abbot Kinney. Uber stays very busy in SaMo so why aren't we capitalizing on it? Not to mention it will free up the bottlenecks in Downtown Santa Monica (particularly Arizona, Colorado, and Broadway between Ocean and Lincoln).    - Create a forum for home owners (not renters) to meet and discuss how they feel about the city and things that can be improved. After all, owners are the ones paying taxes.    - The city is making it increasingly difficult and costly for people to make upgrades to their homes. Permits are harder to get, inspections are getting tougher to pass (probably the toughest of any other city in the state), building codes are intensifying...all these things make it impossible for old homes (some over 100 years old) to be upgraded without an exorbitant amount of money and work. What's particularly bothersome are the large developers who bought their way into this town and are building huge developments that are incredibly ugly to look at, namely the multi-colored structures recently built near Tongva Park. And residents who actually live and pay taxes in the city can't have a say in their own home without going through a painstaking process that may or may not get permitted? That's just absurd.    - Parts of the city need a facelift, particularly commercial areas (e.g. Lincoln Blvd. south of Pico). Ugly storefronts, old stores...the city should give incentives for store owners to make improvements, particularly to their storefronts, so it's more pleasing to look at for residents and visitors.     - Jobs for residents.

Preferential parking ends up in primarily residents getting tickets, even though it's supposed to protect residents. It's a major income stream for Santa Monica and I think it's wrong. One time my license plate was damaged in a car accident and replaced and I was immediately given a ticket since it didn't match my parking sticker, while I was still waiting for my new preferential parking pass to come in the mail. The ticket was not excused when I contested it.    I know that there are many wealthy people here, but the expectation that everyone here be rich makes it very difficult to get by. It's a huge amount of pressure on my husband and I to make enough to pay mortgage each month, and it seems that all we do is work.

2015,"I would like the city to stop building so many apartments, we have plenty.  If we need to build more housing, I would like to see condos and/or houses to encourage more permanent living in Santa Monica.  Apartments, by definition, are a transient housing situation.  Home ownership (either condo or house) is a more permanent housing condition and does more to build a sustainable community.  We also need more entry-level permanent housing here.  It is hard to jump from apartment renting directly into a house in Santa Monica, houses are too expensive.  More condos would allow a lower cost option for the younger, single people who are renting all the small apartments to be able to continue to live in Santa Monica as they marry, want to start a family, and want a more permanent housing situation.  They would need a lower cost option for home ownership to start, then be able to move up.  We shouldn't have a housing situation where we invite all the young, energetic professionals to the city as renters, then not allow for any housing options as they want to establish themselves, get married, and have children, and need bigger spaces for a growing family.  We want them to stay in the community and continue to build for its future.  We have great schools here, but when young couples want to start families, we don't have enough reasonably priced choices for home ownership, so they end up leaving the city.  We are lacking lower-priced and mid-priced home OWNERSHIP choices.  Stop building apartments, start building condos and houses so our young, professional residents will be able to stay here as they grow and start families.  Oh, and one more thing...keep the Santa Monica airport!  It is an asset to Santa Monica, and the entire area.  I lived near the airport for years and was well aware it was there when I moved in.

Because I am certain that if the City succeeds in closing the airport it will become a very densely developed area, further destroying the city. I think the airport is a valuable and integral part of the city which should be kept open. The jets don't bother me at all in terms of noise or safety and, in my opinion are less intrusive in terms of noise than the prop planes (and safer).

2015,"I moved to Santa Monica 18 years ago from New York City because it was   a beautiful blend of small, beautiful, progressive and sophisticated.  Perhaps it is the bad economy, the overcrowding in the city or the  anti smoking law, but Santa Monica has become radically less friendly,   devolving into tense and hostile.      The anti smoking law in particular has been hell.  I do not smoke, but   someone I care about does, and we may as well be second class   citizens.  Please provide acceptable outdoor locations to smoke at other   than the middle of the street or some back alley, please provide services   to help people quit, and please tell people to calm down a bit.  If nothing else,  please inform Santa Monica citizens that smoking in publicly acceptable locations   is not ""loitering"".  It's ""smoking"" in a publicly acceptable location.    Maybe you can sue big tobacco and use the money for quitting support, but   the law that essentially drives smokers out of the city borders on   discriminatory (and I often wonder if parts of it are legal).  I understand   the 2nd hand smoke concern, but the current solution of huddling in alleyways   while neighbors treat you with contempt - legally justified or otherwise -   does not strike me as optimal, and certainly, don't ask me about how much I   like living in Santa Monica.    [XXX]    While you are at it, please get rid of Carbon Monoxide fumes from cars completely,   all traffic violators because they are very dangerous people, noise pollution   because it keeps my son awake undermining his health, pollen since he's asthmatic,   ebola is on the rise - 1.4 Million cases in next 4 months - but not in Santa Monica please,  leprosy since... eww, gross..., stupid people since they are - you know,   stupid - an iq test to apply to live in Santa Monica would be preferable but oh, please take   every tax dollar these people are willing to spend.  I got it - 2nd hand smoke - bad!    (For the humorless, the above paragraph is facetious - it's okay if you chuckled).    The tobacco industry has turned millions of people into addicts robbing them  of decades of life - a crime against humanity worthy of Hitler, but I expect   a city as intelligent and progressive as Santa Monica   to come up with a better solution than what we currently have.  Homeless people   receive better treatment from Santa Monica than hard working, 2nd class addicts.    There are some good people among these addicts, and they may be trying to quit,   but Santa Monica has created an environment hostile to them that undermines   their efforts to free themselves of an addiction they may never have had the support   to avoid as young children.    [XXX]  This is why Santa Monica is considered ""crazy"" by so many.  Your   enlightened self righteousness has become bullying, elitist and discriminatory.    Can you please clarify that a designated smoking unit has the legal right to   smoke with their window open?  Can you inform smokers of what their rights   *are*?  Because right now, if someone smokes outside, the culture is now   ignorantly hostile and cruel. [XXX]  So this law has culturally empowered people ignorant of the law's specifics to   rant hostilely at myself and my wife.  Nice.  Great work.  ""How do you like   living here you second class citizen?""  How about you *not* send this survey   to smokers, because, come one, you want them out of your city anyway, so why ask  their opinion; it's not like it matters to you.  I love the irony that other cities   send us their homeless - which is deplorable - but apparently, we send *them*   our smokers.  Okay.  Interesting, morally awful solution.  Way to take the low road!    The city has become too big, overdeveloped, lost its ""progressive, but smallish   town"" quality, where people would say hi on the street, and now has a cramped,   ""bad economy / too much traffic / no privacy"" kind of stress to it that taxes and fatigues   me.  Simply, I have come to dislike living here considerably.  I earn good money,   bring many dollars into the US and innovate technologically all in the hardest economy   in nearly 90 years, I find myself, not looking to a community or neighbors for   support, but rather, aspiring to get out of this overcrowded and invasive bunch   of ignorant social climbers, real estate flippers, trust fund children and ne'er do wells.

When you have rent control, but also allow landlords to raise to market rate when people move out, you stack *all* the incentives for landlords to become slumlords and try to push current residents out, especially long-term tenants. That is, they try to avoid doing regular maintenance, etc.. until the tenant moves out, and only then do they do the basic repairs, whatever is enough to get someone to move in at the new market rate. The result is that all the apartments are crappy, and the longest-dwelling citizens -- who are the ones that actually make up a lot of the community -- get pushed out in favor of younger, wealthier, but disengaged yuppies.

2015,"I would like to improve relations with my landlord, who does everything he can to undermine my health and well-being, [XXX]  I walk every day in Santa Monica. Walking is becoming a VERY risky activity here, because at least 20% of drivers flout traffic rules (e.g., they speed, drive on the wrong side of the rode) as a matter of course. This is the single biggest threat to my health and well-being, which I face on a daily basis. Yet, the police spend an inordinate amount of time harassing and otherwise violating the rights of homeless people rather than enforcing traffic rules. On public buses, the City has launched an Orwellian PR campaign, which blames pedestrians for traffic fatalities. [XXX] In Santa Monica, driving is a right and walking is a privilege. Walking while homeless has quite obviously become a crime here.    This decidedly unhealthy and unsafe situation is symptomatic of the shift in City policies, which favor the wealthy elite and over everyone else.",Housing,Protection of rent control tenants' interests,Transport,Improved infrastructure for cycling/pedestrians,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015,"I think most of my neighbors are very concerned about the rising cost of housing in Santa Monica, and whether, if something happened to the housing unit we're in, we would be priced out of the area. Land is so very enticing there and we worry that our landlady will sell up and we will be homeless. Which brings me to the awful plight of the homeless.....I know Santa Monica is doing a LOT for that population, but it can be hazardous making your way around the neighborhood early in the morning (I go to work early) or out for an evening stroll. I have been lunged at, bitten by a dog, yelled at and had our garage broken into. But I know most residents have had some experience or another in this regard. The police are fantastic, though. They're courteous, not bullying; they just maintain a presence and respond when necessary. I appreciate that, too.   I would love it if there were no traffic allowed downtown or that certain streets, other than Third Street, were roped off...just for pedestrians. It makes for a sense of well-being just being able to walk freely without worrying about being run over.     Thank you for conducting this survey!

Too much traffic, being made worse by the ever increasing selling out of our community to big business/builders  There's already WAY too much traffic and NOT ENOUGH parking.  It's bad enough we have to PAY to park on our OWN streets, but sometimes there isn't even any space to park.  Then we have to worry about the ever vigilant parking police.  Heaven forbid you forget to put your pass up, or run in your friends house and take 2 minutes too long to get their visitor pass...you get a ticket for parking in your own neighborhood.    #2..the homeless people.  There are too many of them, and they congregate in certain areas.  I'm sure some are harmless, but you never know.  Even though my children are 12 and 10, I don't feel safe letting them walk more than one block away from my home.  There are regular homeless people that live in the alleyways.  One is extremely dirty and openly drinking beer almost every day at 7:30 am, as I drive my children to school. I've had more than one altercation with the homeless, just walking down the street in the middle of the day off of Santa Monica Blvd.  So there's no way I feel safe letting my kids walk around their neighborhood.    Cost of living is too high and taxes are too high.  The glorious public school system was a disappointment, (also not a safe environment, with regular theft, bullying, inappropriate behavior...many of the offenders, by the way are permitted in from LAUSD. They don't pay all these taxes, so why are they even allowed in?  Maybe I'm biased, but I volunteered in the school at least once a week for 5 years, and this was my experience) so we pay for private school, but we still pay all the higher taxes for the schools.     So basically we pay a lot to live in a dirty, unsafe, congested city.  The only reason I stay is because it's close to my work, and I feel rooted by my church, and now my childrens' school [XXX].  This parish is the main reason I feel connected to the community, not because anything the city has provided.    Maybe if the parking police started patrolling for dog owners that don't pick up poop, they'd have a more positive impact in our community, than they currently do.

2015,"We should implement noise abatement in all forms possible.  We have come to believe that it is OK for urban environments to be this noisy.  It is not.  Many of our residents live immediately adjacent to busy roadways and very much needs to be done to quiet the Santa Monica community.  Many studies have shown that proximity to noisy environments has numerous negative health effects.     There are many noisy activities the city can address directly.  First, City buses and garbage trucks should be quieted with available technology (e.g., more restrictive mufflers).  Second, new roads should be paved with quiet (i.e., rubberized) pavement.  The Phoenix metro area has great examples on how to implement and achieve this.  Third, our police force goes under-utilized much of the time.  Officers should cite motorists/motorcyclists with exclusively noisy exhausts and/or radio.  Incentives should be offered to apartment building owners to install noise-reducing windows.  The building code should be revised to ensure noise transfer in minimized between units.    We live on top of each other here in Santa Monica.  Noise reduction would go a long way to making that situation more tolerable.  While Europe is just starting to grapple with this urban challenge, there is yet little will in the United States to address noisy urban environments.  Santa Monica could lead the way in these efforts!",City general,Noise,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015,"I would like to have Santa Monica create more public parks- small parks every other block.  Our blocks north of Montana are sometimes 22 lots long or longer.  We need small parks throughout the city:  new mothers have no place to take small children to get out of their baby carriages and play on the grass in a public park; or look at the butterflies in a corner ""goose-egg"" park.  It's a crying need.  Why are we unable to designate such spaces?  Parents are isolated in their houses - a park would be a place they could meet other parents, other children without strapping their children into a carseat (backbreaking) and driving them to the Ywca or to Douglas Park or another big park.  They should be able to meet parent-neighbors and arrange play dates and just congregate w/other young parents. Parents & sm. children are often lonely.",City general,Community gardens/Green space,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015,[XXX]   I wish when I walked our of my condo that the streets and the landscaping were as nice as they are just three blocks away near Main Street.    My part of 7th seems like Santa Monica doesn't care about planting nice trees and keeping the sidewalks nice.   It makes a big diffrnce since then you want to leave your neighborhood to just take a quick stroll.   Also cleaning up Lincoln in this area would go along way.  A new Starbucks opened and it's not the specific established but again the facades of the building that make you want to walk around.    I think this part of SM could really use beautification and love so people don't feel forced to walk to Main Street.,City general,Cleanliness/Maintenance,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Also adequately sized toilet stalls with doors that function and locks and bolts that work. And toilets that have privacy do people don't invade your privacy.

2015,"I'd really like to see more quiet spaces in Santa Monica. It's a beautiful place, but as an apartment/condo dweller it's very difficult to find a quiet spot. Most of the apartments have very thin walls, very little private outdoor space and lots of road noise from cars, buses and trucks. The parks tend to be full of exercisers with boomboxes and the libraries tend to be full of homeless people. I frequent both parks and libraries often, but they're not very peaceful places.

Several bystanders stopped them and the police were called, but it was very upsetting that they would think they could get away with that at all. I've noticed that, that intersection seems to have a major problem with loitering and it is frustrating that while, I feel safe walking down my street (12th) at any time or the day or night, I do not feel comfortable on Pico after dark. I have been cat-called and made to feel threatened in my own neighborhood. I have had similar encounters on 11th St heading across the 10 towards 3rd St Promenade.

2015,"I would like the city to stop allowing so much new condo construction. The traffic and parking make the quality of life here miserable. I know that all of Los Angeles would like to be Manhattan, but we're not set up for that. The Big Blue Bus is pretty decent- mass transit outside of Santa Monica is a joke. I tried living without a car for 1 year. Worst experience ever. I work in different locations for each job and my hours vary wildly. It would sometimes take 2+ hours to get to a location in the morning. Riding home late at night is not safe. There are many mentally ill people roaming around that really shouldn't be. I ended up renting cars frequently. I'm sure the trains will help once they're open in 2020. (Yeah, I know they claim 2016. Whatever.)    Parking is a nightmare here. I live close to the 3rd Street Promenade. Between people visiting the city and the hotel employees that use all our street parking it makes it impossible to just live my life. We finally got permit parking here, but it almost doesn't matter. There are just too many people.     I realize that you didn't ask me what the city could do to improve my life, but I don't feel like my voice is heard. I'm not a wealthy real estate developer nor a giant hotel corporation so I'm not really worth much to SM.     We do recycle everything we can and we use as little water as possible. We can't really compost because we live in a small apartment with no yard.

All I've seen the last several years is the continuing development of the downtown area.  It's becoming more and more crowded with visitors/tourists, so much so that I rarely ever go there because it's not designed for locals.  I get mail about new hi-rise luxury buildings going up with prices that I couldn't even afford.  The new Expo line will only bring more crowds and the homeless in.  Most days you can't even ride your bike at the beach because of all the tourists walking all over the bike paths.    Overall, as a resident, I feel that I can't even enjoy some of the best parts of our city.  I understand tourism is an important part of Santa Monica, but it has been for decades.  Visitors will still come here without all the luxury condos and designer stores.  We don't need to portray ourselves as being this elite beach mecca where people come to ogle at what they can't afford.

Why does it all have to be started at the same time.  And we don't need more restrictions and permits on parking in residential areas. Parking is such a stress and almost non-existent in Santa Monica or so limited as to force residents not to shop, etc. downtown.  Some meters now are effective until 9pm instead of 6pm.  Parking structures are full.  But the City is building more and more housing, higher flowers (7 stories at Fred Segal's corner) and the train will bring in many more pedestrians.

The completion of work on the 405 has not eased the pain in Santa Monica with regard to getting anywhere east of here. I think the wellbeing of the community as a whole is in danger of being destroyed to the point that those of us who cherish this place will not want to remain.

High-density development in mixed-use zones severely impacts the quality of life in those areas.

I wish the city would do the same, instead of creating a ""city arboretum"" of flora introduced from all over the world. It is ludicrous to me to ""help save endangered species"" from other countries and continents rather than those we are losing right here under our noses. We should be supporting pollinators--our own, not European honey bees--and the plants they have evolved with over millennia. We ought to be caring for the future of our children's food supply, clean air, precious water if we are fortunate enough to be getting any. Do our city planners not know, or not care, that the insects and animals that have evolved here--including our very efficient pollinators--can make use of only 7-10% of the vegetation they keep introducing here from elsewhere in the name of beautification and protecting the ""world's"" endangered species? We could do so much to improve the quality of life here, for now and for the future, if we would commit to restoring Santa Monica's vegetation and water supply to what has naturally occurred here for eons.

I wish Santa Monica City reinforced STRICTER rules on landlords for what they must do regarding maintenance. The rules today are too vague and too much effort, work and time is put on the tenants to deal with it. It's unfair and causes lots of stressed and minimizes quality of life. Even with departments like Rent Control Board, Santa Monica Renters Right and City Attirney's Office you still get very little help and mostly just the run-around and in the end recommended to seek help elsewhere (attorney).  I understand that landlords buy and own buildings as an investment and to make money, but no tenant should have to deal with harassment of any kind nor having to live in misery due to landlords neglect and profits. City of Santa Monica should establish strict rules that after a certain amount of years, for example walls should be painted, windows exchanged, new or updated to today's standards electrical outlets, hardwood floors resurfaced etc, etc. I think it's unfair that just because we live in rent controlled units the landlords don't have to put any money into maintenance and upgrades.

I see it tipping more and more toward the ultra rich and catering to in particular wealthy tourists and business people who need short-term housing. Yes our city is of course a highly popular place to visit from around the world due to its natural beauty and magnificent Bay, but it is HOME to those who are not travelers and at only 8 square miles, I see a battle for space going on now that pits these interests against each other. I see Santa Monica for Sale, and I am grateful to have come here early enough to have known it before this era. Hopefully we can stem the tide by electing people who will be guardians of the city by the people and for the people, and not for oligarchs and hi tech millionaires.",Housing,Affordability,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015,"I am a native, and in my experience, SM fosters a sense of entitlement in it's residents that is often frustrating and can be destructive. From the Renters Rights movement to the fence height restrictions SM is referred to by many as the People's Republic of Santa Monica, a place where ""the will of the people"" can win out over responsible public policy and fair dealing.  For example, in a strengthening economy, the annual Rent Control Board increase was the lowest(less than 1%) it has been in history. This broken local bureaucracy results in a multitude of run down, derelict looking multifamily properties throughout the city.  It doesn't make sense- rent control is contributing to Urban decay in our community.   There are other well intended policies and regulations in Santa Monica that are similarly outdated, contributing to discord among residents.",Housing,Remove rent control/Address gaming the system,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015,There is one important aspect of my Santa Monica residency which adversely affects my sense of community and well being. [XXX] i feel discriminated against and treated unfairly by city council/administration. The city's current form of rent control is imbalanced.

2015,"I worry that most people are getting priced out of Santa Monica and that it is becoming way too touristy commercial and expensive. It's losing its vibe and feels like a place that if for the very affluent.    It's a shame that such a wonderful place is not more accessible to people of all income levels who share desire to live in a city that offers such a wonderful quality of life. There is very little ethnic diversity in my neighborhood which I often miss.    I'd like to see the garbage truck noise in the alleys that happens several times a week addressed.

I have closely followed the housing crisis in San Francisco and the tensions between tech workers (and the skyrocketing rents they've caused) and long-term San Franciscans. [XXX] I love to see the increase in jobs and companies come to SM, but I do worry about the increasing rents, more expensive shops / cost of living, crowding, changing demographics of the city.  I think rent control will help play a key role, but things like even childcare and groceries and eating out can price a family out of the neighborhood.",Housing,Affordability,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015,"I would like to see more affordable and updated housing options that are not rent controlled. Some of the nicest/more updated apartments on the market are salary capped. When you make over that limit you pay nearly $1000 more to live in units that are outdated and could stand a little work. I like that there are affordable options for middle income people but their is a disconnect between this and those who want to stay in Santa Monica and make just over the limit. A fresh look at housing would be great, it's very pricey for not great units. IE: on average $2,000 for a slightly updated one bedroom. Not quite affordable if you are single...and it already sucks to be single :)",Housing,Affordability,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It would be brilliant if the city could come up with a resident pass that allows them to park anywhere in the city. The pass could be reasonably charged annually. It is so frustrating when I want to go to a store or a friends house and I can't park. This would eliminate that frustration. Also, affordable housing for middle class residents. Most working families can not afford to live in Santa Monica and they make too much money to qualify for affordable housing, but not enough money to actually rent or buy, unless there is rent control.",Housing,Affordability,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Being a tenant in a rent control building for 30 years has afforded me the lifestyle of living in SM, I would not have been able to afford to live here had it not been for that.  The downside is building maintnance.  Having low rent should not equate to living in a terrible, unkept, poorly maintained building where the owner cares less if the building needs repairs, paint, gardening etc.  The condition of many rent control building units across SM are less than favorable, but the low rent keeps tenants in fear of speaking out.",Housing,Affordability,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I spend a lot of time outside, and most of the unhoused that I encounter seem deeply unhappy, to say the least.

And I fear that the number of unhoused will rise drastically once the Metro is finished.    Residents who negotiate this situation often resort to what I call ""selective vision""--however I cannot use my vision like that, at least anymore. Visitors don't care enough--they are not involved with Santa Monica--they come, they play, they spend money, they leave. But it is different for residents--especially residents who are not able to distract themselves with what Santa Monica has to offer regarding various forms of entertainment.    I don't have suggestions at this point. [XXX] Santa Monica has to examine what it means to more or less permanently host such a large number of individuals who are forced into a parasitic position, and what that does to the community as a hole.    [XXX] and I hear and see unhoused people virtually every time I go outside--many of them crying, yelling, screaming, asking for money, food, clothing, etc. I can't run an errand without having to negotiate continual misery.    I have found unhoused people hiding in my patio, under the foliage around my building, and out back, rummaging through trashcans, at all hours of the day and night. I cannot get through one day without having my guts wrenched out because I don't know what to do when coming upon someone who needs everything!    Grouping the unhoused under the heading of Santa Monica's famous ""social-diversity"" is simply eliding the dire problem of how to manage a growing number of unhoused people who are simply trying to survive, in a way that not only protects their humanity, but also takes into account the mental welfare of the rest of the urban community who must deal with them on a daily basis.    Those of us who cannot apply selective vision to our surroundings find the situation emotionally intolerable.     There is no simple solution--but Santa Monica at least has to start asking the right questions.",Local services,Homeless,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2015,"I am upset about the 2014 regulations on group exercise in Santa Monica parks.  I used to do boot camp in Clover Park early in the mornings.  It was great.  Clover Park was designed for that sort of exercise, with good jogging paths, stations for pull-ups, sit-ups, dips, etc., and a huge amount of space.  However, because of a problem on the other side of the city, where exercisers were overrunning small parks that never were designed as exercise facilities, my boot camp in Clover Park was moved to Venice, in a far inferior park farther away from my home.  I need the group aspect of boot camp to keep me motivated and active.  This regulation made it more difficult for me to do that and immediately impacted my life negatively for no good reason.  The regulation is overly broad and should be limited to the parks and medians that were subject to the problem in the first place.  This sloppy rule-making is detrimental to life in Santa Monica, and I do not feel that I have a voice to correct it.  I would revise the anti-group-exercise ordinance to apply only to the parks that experienced the problems, rather than effectively prohibiting me from working out with a trainer in a group in my own neighborhood where there never was a problem posed.",Local services,Fitness and wellbeing facilities,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Reed Park is getting ruined.  That being said, most of the homeless people are harmless and kind, but we have seen people having sex (at Reed Park), pulling down their pants, urinating and defecating on the street, harassing the kids that walk to and from school.

This has happened to me both with and without my child with me. It also makes the neighborhood feel a little unsafe. With the amount of property taxes that I and other homeowners pay, you would think that the city of Santa Monica would figure out a way to solve the homeless problem, instead of creating more silly laws like outdoor smoking and training people in the park without a permit.

2015,I feel like people with dogs force them on neighbors who don't like dogs.  Barking isn't so bad (at the moment) but there's a CONSTANT stream of people walking dogs who seem to think I should feel honored if their dog urinates on my steps or leaves feces on the sidewalk in front (my front door is near the sidewalk).

2015,i would like to join a gym in the near future. as far as the community i think the city would benefit if as a whole things were open later.

As far as food options it pretty much just fast food that is open late among the city. I think simply changes like this would have a great positive effect on our city and peoples moods!,Other,Other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2015,"TRAFFIC!  THE CITY NEEDS TO FIGURE IT OUT!  The city streets aren't safe enough to let children bike anywhere because of all the crazy driver commuters that cut through our residential streets.  The city needs to realize that it isn't realistic for residents to absorb the traffic.   Residents that have young children need to pick them up from school and drive them to lessons, etc, with multiple kids, it's not realistic or practical for us to take the bus.  The residents of Santa Monica are unhappy because we are prisoners in our homes during rush hour.  I imagine this survey came about because Santa Monica was rated ""stressed out"".   The reason we are stressed out is the traffic.  Some lunatic driver close to SMC actually swerved around my young daughter when she was crossing on a crosswalk to go into JAMS.  This is why we are stressed.  We don't even feel safe crossing in a crosswalk next to a school!",Transport,Improved infrastructure for cycling/pedestrians,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015,"I ride a bike to commute to work; however, I am very tired of the City taking away driving and trun lanes on major streets.  This ""Calming Traffic"" has just made things more congested and harder to get around when I do drive my car.  Also, traffic coming out of Santa Monica at night into Venice every week day is outragious.  With only three ways to get South (Lincoln, 23rd Street and Bundy), it is a nightmare to watch the back up almost everyday.  All the jobs created and nothing has been done to the streets to make it easier for the thousands of people who commute in and out of Santa Monica everyday.  When I get home at night, I can not go south or east.  To get to Westside Pavillion, 4 miles, is at least an hour.  And the City is still talking about more development.  Bring in more commuters.  The train does not go north and south.  Santa Monica needs to start discussing ways to improve traffic.",Transport,Congestion,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015,The pollution that comes into my house from the heavy traffic on Michigan Avenue and the freeway.   The wall which gives some noise and pollution protection from the 10 freeway stops at 10th street. At this point the noise is terrible. upon testing the air in my house it shows 2000 to 4000 microns during peak traffic hours it is 4000 from 8:00 am until 10:30am  it drops to 2500 to 3000 during mid day and goes up again between 3 and 6:30pm   Something needs to be done immediately to help with the air quality.  I don't believe the city cares about the health of those affected by the pollution created on Michigan Avenue in Santa Monica between 7th and 10th Street.  The noise factor is also so loud as it has increased in the last 32 years by at least 300%.  The combination has made it a very unhealthy situation.,Transport,Congestion,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015,I really hate that there is never a time (other than street cleaning hours) when there are not cars parked in front on my house and every other house on the block.  I really hate when I come out and see that a car has been parked so that it hangs into my driveway and then I have to call parking services and I have to wait around for them to arrive to ticket or tow the offending vehicle.  I really hate that the city allows parking that blocks driveways and assumes that any car parked this way is because the property owner allows it.  Require a tag to do this and get the meter maids out and have them ticket any car that is hanging over into a driveway.  This will do two things - increase revenue for the city and force drivers to be considerate when parking in residential neighborhoods.,Transport,Parking,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015,"Don't want the Metro!  It can't possible help improve Santa Monica.  It will destroy property values and cause traffic, not alleviate.  It will increase crime.  It's a terrible idea and wish it would go away.  Whoever thought this up, was crazy or is not a homeowner.  The last thing we need is to bring in more people into the city - promenade, beaches and pier are already crowded and inaccessible on the weekends for residents.   People who would use public transport are not coming here to spend money and instead, you will lose your permanent residents who do shop here to go elsewhere - Century City, WLA.  City Hall needs to forget how much has already been wasted on the Metro project and stop the bleeding before it destroys the city.",Transport,Other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015,"I like to have a better public transportation system. where the buses have their schedule of arrivals electronically posted and I know how much time I need to wait without being disappointed.  I also like to be able to travel around town or out of town on Metro, trains, any form of reliable public transportation.  I think the buses (Blue buses) in Santa Monica are a shame to the city and a betrayal of our trust in those who make the decisions. They never arrive on time, they are scheduled not frequently enough enough to be useful for a working person and are unreliable. i want to see the city work on what we already have rather than promises of what we can or may have in the future.",Transport,Public transport,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015,"Eliminate everyone's need to drive/have cars. Santa Monica has too much traffic. It is completely unsafe now, and getting even worse. My wellbeing would be improved if (a) I didn't have to drive anywhere, and (b) the city would stop approving projects which cause MORE CARS to come into the city limits each day. Please help!!! And encouraging bicycling is NOT the solution -- that will only lead to more bicyclists being hurt/injured. It is not safe to ride a bike here! Even being a pedestrian is perilous. Thanks for whatever you can do to consider these facts. Note: FACTS. These are not opinions. It is very unsafe to drive, bike or walk in this city!",Transport,Improved infrastructure for cycling/pedestrians,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015,"I would like less traffic. The increase in traffic has greatly affected our lives since we moved here 18 years ago. It affects when we move about the city, how we move about the city, and when we use our downtown as opposed to going to other downtowns because ours is too congested. Traffic even affects when I get exercise because if the traffic is very backed up, bike riding and fast walking (my 2 major forms of exercise) seem almost unhealthy because of the air quality. The traffic has the many residents I am in contact with love our city less and it's very unfortunate. I will vote for candidates who are willing to take the issue on.",Transport,Improved infrastructure for cycling/pedestrians,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015,"Decrease car and air traffic substantially. Prohibit and enforce all gas and electric vehicles, as well as Segways, from the beach strand. Curb (high-rise) development. Make accessible, by foot or bike, each of the major neighborhoods: Main Street, through the Promenade, to Montana Avenue, for example. Enforce smoking bans in public spaces and multi-family residential buildings. Continue to encourage walking, cycling, and public transportation. Re-design the new bus stops. Improve Lincoln Blvd traffic flow and aesthetics. Incentivize restaurants to have a low carbon footprint and advertise it.",Transport,Congestion,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015,"Make walking (and biking) a lot safer in our community.  Drivers are beginning to yield more frequently to pedestrians, but there are TOO MANY instances where drivers are neither patient nor particularly courteous to pedestrians.  I know we live in Car Culture LA, but Santa Monica has become such a pedestrian- and bike-friendly city, that drivers need to adjust their driving habits.  Pedestrian heavy cities in the East Coast, such as Boston, have performed ""Operation Crosswalk"" to ticket drivers.  Perhaps we can do something similar on a more frequent basis to educate these DRIVERS.",Transport,Improved infrastructure for cycling/pedestrians,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The City and Council need to step up and fix this ever-growing problem NOW!",Transport,Congestion,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015,"It's forbidden to ride bicycles on the sidewalks yet I am bothered every day, as a pedestrian, by people riding their bike on the sidewalk. There should be a campaign: there are more and more bike riders in Santa Monica and it's beginning to be an issue. The code should be enforced. Pedestrians have to suffer the lack of courtesy from car drivers; they shouldn't feel unsafe on the sidewalks because of this new hazard represented by bicycles.",Transport,Improved infrastructure for cycling/pedestrians,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015,I would like to see the traffic decrease from Santa Monica College. Whenever they are in session out neighborhood becomes impacted with traffic. One way I think that this could improve is having more students park at SM airport and they get bused into the main campus. The only people that should be allowed to park at the college would be SM residents. This would alleviate much of the traffic that impacts our city from the college students.,Transport,Congestion,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The unbridled, miserable entitlement of people who are absurdly selfish, and do what they want - the neighbor who stomps all night and slams doors and rents her apartment out illegally as a hotel, the unhappy drivers texting and refusing to stop for pedestrians and constantly honking, etc can mar an otherwise naturally pretty town.

2015,"I would like it if non-major roads were closed to cars so that biking is safer. Despite the many well-maintained bike lanes around the city, cars do not look for/consider cyclists.

Save the city, bury Lincoln! Start the movement Santa Monica.",Transport,Public transport,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015,We need school busses! How many thousands of cars drive their children to school twice a day in SM? And the BBB route my kid would have taken to SaMoHi just got rerouted--my kid walked to Franklin and Lincoln Schools but I am not comfortable with her hanging out at a bus stop on Wilshire or Olympic Blvds.

2015,I would add more parking and make parking less expensive. Cannot go anywhere in Santa Monica because after you fight traffic to go to a place that is 3 miles away but  takes 45 minutes to get to there is either no parking or the parking is so expensive it is prohibitive to go there. I rarely go out in Santa Monica anyone.... I really am sorry I moved here & now feel trapped.,Transport,Parking,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015,All traffic signals should default to a 'walk' signal automatically at ALL intersections 1) drivers will slow down (too many car/pedestrian accidents in recent years 2) it will help the elderly to be able to start crossing sooner 3) when I do early am walk it seems odd to wait for 'walk' sign when there is no vehicular traffic 4) why not encourage walking???,Transport,Improved infrastructure for cycling/pedestrians,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
