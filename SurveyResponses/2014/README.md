# 2014 Wellbeing Survey Data

* `3,182` unique (i.e., not duplicates) responses
* `542` respondents completed 20 questions or less, so these were removed (reducing the sample to `2,640`)
* `319` respondents were not currently residing in Santa Monica, and were therefore removed as well (further reducing the sample to `2,321`)
* `83` respondents did not complete all demographic questions (i.e. age, gender, zip code and ethnicity), and were removed

Our analysis included this final sample of `2,238` respondents.
