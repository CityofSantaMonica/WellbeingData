# Wellbeing Findings

At the core of The Wellbeing Project is the Wellbeing Index, a measurement tool that provides an understanding of wellbeing in our community.

The findings data represents a distillation of research into the demographic, survey, social media, and City administrative data sources that comprise the Index.

Use our [online tool](https://cityofsantamonica.github.io/wellbeing-findings/src/) to explore these findings.
